# Given two non-empty arrays of integers, our goal is to write a function that
# establishes whether the second array is a valid subsequence of
# the first array. A valid subsequence of an array is classified as
# a set of numbers that aren’t necessarily adjacent in the array but
# are in the same order as they appear in the array.
# For example, [2, 5, 6] and [2, 6] are both considered as valid subsequences
# of the array [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. It is also important to note that [2]
# and [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] are both valid subsequences of the array.
#
# Sample:
#
# Input array → [3, 6, 23, 7, 2, 4]
#
# Sequence → [3, 7, 4]
# 
# Output → True

def is_valid_subsequence(self, subSequenceString, originalString):
    seqIdx = 0
    for value in originalString:
        if seqIdx == len(subSequenceString):
            break
        if subSequenceString[seqIdx] == value:
            seqIdx += 1
    return seqIdx == len(subSequenceString)
