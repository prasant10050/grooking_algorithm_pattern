# Given a non-empty array containing unique integers and a target sum,
# you have to write a function that should return an array containing
# any two unique numbers from the input array; however,
# if there are no pair of numbers that sum up to the target sum,
# the function should return an empty array.
#
# Example:
#
# Array: [-2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 9, 7]
#
# Target sum: 14
# 
# Output: [5, 9] # [9, 5] works as well, but you canâ€™t add an integer to itself
# so [7, 7] does not worka
