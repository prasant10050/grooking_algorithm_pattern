# Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is a happy number.
#
# We use the following process to check if a given number is a happy number:
#
# Starting with the given number n , replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits.
# Repeat the process until:
#     1. The number equals 1 , which will depict that the given number n is a happy number.
#     2. The number enters a cycle, which will depict that the given number n is not a happy number.
# Return TRUE if n is a happy number, and FALSE if not.
